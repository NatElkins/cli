    ```

* Don't generate `U1` if an union is resolved to a single type

    Fuse.version"""
            and set (value: string) =
                emitJsExpr (value) $$"""
    import { Fuse } from "module";
    Fuse.version = $0"""
    ```

* Supports private static property

    ```ts
    export declare class SettingsContainer {
        static #privateField;
    }

        static member inline private ``#privateField``
            with get () : unit =
                emitJsExpr () $$"""
    import { SettingsContainer } from "module";
    SettingsContainer.#privateField"""
            and set (value: unit) =

    SettingsContainer.#privateField = $0"""
    ```

* Add support for optional type

    ```ts
    export type LatLngTuple = [number, number, number?];
    ```

    ```fs
    type LatLngTuple = float * float * float option
    ```

* Add support for `readonly` TypeOperator

    ```ts
    export type ReadonlyArray<T> = readonly T[];
    ```

    ```fs
    type ReadonlyArray<'T> = ResizeArray<'T>
    ```

* Optimise `IntersectionType` inside of `TypeArguments`

    ```ts
    export type RecordEntryObject = {
        v: string
        n: number
    }

    export type RecordEntryArrayItem = ReadonlyArray<
        RecordEntryObject & { i: number }
    >
    ```

    ```fs
    [<AllowNullLiteral>]
    [<Interface>]
    type RecordEntryObject =
        abstract member v: string with get, set
        abstract member n: float with get, set

    type RecordEntryArrayItem =
        ResizeArray<RecordEntryArrayItem.ReadonlyArray.ReturnType>

    module RecordEntryArrayItem =

        module ReadonlyArray =

            [<AllowNullLiteral>]
            [<Interface>]
            type ReturnType =
                abstract member v: string with get, set
                abstract member n: float with get, set
                abstract member i: float with get, set
    ```

* Add support for default export assignment
* Add support for `object` type alias

        ```ts
        export type MyObject = object;
        ```

        ```fs
        type MyObject = obj
        ```
* Add support for converting tsdoc to xml doc comments

### Changed

* Replace `Boolean` with `bool`
* Map `Date` type to `JS.Date` ([GH-48](https://github.com/glutinum-org/cli/issues/48))
* Decorate all interface with `[<Interface>]` attribute this is to ensure they are erased at runtime even if they only have `static member` attached to them
* Private field are not exposed in the F# code, because F# interface doesn't support them

    ```ts
    export declare class SettingsContainer {
        #privateField;
    }
    ```

    ```fs
    [<AllowNullLiteral>]
    [<Interface>]
    type SettingsContainer =
        interface end
    ```

* Don't crash on unsupported syntax, instead we log the warning and continue the process. If needed, we default to `obj`
